# Design-of-End-Effector
This repository is about the design of new End Effector, and this design is done to use it in robot balloon battle.

This is the task of designing a new End Effector, this end effector has been designed by using SOLIDWORKS Program, and the attached STL 
file shows the design of the end effector. This End Effector is designed to be set on a Robot Arm and this robot will duel another robot and pop the balloon set on it, to pop the enemy's balloon, there should be a sharp End Effector. The end effector designed in this task is characterised by more than one sharp edge and they are five sharp edges. One of the advantages of this end effector that if the enemy's balloon escaped the middle sharp edge there will be four other sharp edges one of them can pop's the enemy balloon. In addition, the end effector has been catted from all directions to reduce the weight of the end effector. Also, there are fillets in most directions to prevent the sharp edges when the user handles the end effector, and from an aesthetic point of view, the designed end effector seems to look like a rose.
